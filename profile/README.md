# Mortgage Recast Calculator – How It Works & Why You Should Use It

When you're looking to reduce your monthly mortgage payments without refinancing, a mortgage recast could be the perfect solution. But how do you know if it's worth it? A Mortgage Recast Calculator can help you determine the impact of recasting your loan by making a lump sum payment. In this guide, we'll cover everything you need to know about mortgage recasting, how to use a calculator for accurate results, and why it might be a better alternative to refinancing.

## What Is a Mortgage Recast?

A mortgage recast is a process where a borrower makes a lump sum payment toward the principal balance of their mortgage, and the lender then recalculates the remaining monthly payments based on the new, lower balance. Unlike refinancing, which involves applying for a new loan, a recast modifies the existing loan without changing the interest rate or loan terms.

### Key Features of a Mortgage Recast:

- **Lower Monthly Payments** – Reduces your monthly financial burden.
- **No Change to Interest Rate** – Keeps your current mortgage rate.
- **Low Fees** – Usually costs less than refinancing.
- **No Credit Check Required** – Since it’s not a new loan, credit approval is not needed.

## How Does a Mortgage Recast Calculator Work?

A Mortgage Recast Calculator helps you estimate how much you can save by recasting your loan. It takes the following inputs:

- **Current Loan Balance** – The remaining amount you owe on your mortgage.
- **Lump Sum Payment** – The extra payment you plan to apply toward your loan.
- **Interest Rate** – The fixed interest rate of your mortgage.
- **Remaining Loan Term** – The number of years left on your mortgage.

### Steps to Use a Mortgage Recast Calculator:

1. Enter your remaining mortgage balance.
2. Input the lump sum amount you wish to apply.
3. Provide your current interest rate.
4. Enter the remaining term of your mortgage.
5. Click “Calculate” to see your new monthly payment.

#### Example Calculation:

- **Current Mortgage Balance:** $250,000  
- **Lump Sum Payment:** $50,000  
- **Interest Rate:** 4.5%  
- **Remaining Term:** 20 years  
- **New Monthly Payment:** $1,267 (down from $1,580)  

In this example, the borrower reduces their monthly payment by $313 per month just by making a $50,000 lump sum payment!

## Mortgage Recast vs. Mortgage Refinance – What’s the Difference?

While both recasting and refinancing can lower your mortgage payments, they work in completely different ways.

| Feature | Mortgage Recast | Mortgage Refinance |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Lowers Monthly Payment | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Requires a New Loan | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Affects Interest Rate | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Requires a Credit Check | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Involves Closing Costs | ❌ Low Fees | ✅ Higher Costs |

### When to Choose Recasting Over Refinancing:

- If you already have a low interest rate and don’t want to refinance.
- If you have extra cash and want to lower payments.
- If you don’t want to go through credit checks or closing costs.

## Pros and Cons of Mortgage Recasting

### ✅ Pros:

✔ **Lower Monthly Payments** – More manageable budgeting.
✔ **Saves on Interest Over Time** – Lower balance = lower total interest paid.
✔ **Keeps Your Current Interest Rate** – No risk of a higher rate.
✔ **Minimal Fees** – Usually between $200–$500.

### ❌ Cons:

✘ **Requires a Lump Sum Payment** – You need extra cash.
✘ **Not Available for All Loans** – Some lenders don’t allow recasting.
✘ **Doesn’t Shorten Loan Term** – Unlike refinancing, the loan term remains unchanged.

## Who Should Consider a Mortgage Recast?

A mortgage recast is best suited for homeowners who:

- Have significant savings or a lump sum available.
- Want to lower monthly payments without changing their loan terms.
- Plan to stay in their home long-term.
- Have a fixed-rate loan (recasting doesn’t work for most adjustable-rate mortgages).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### 1. Can I recast my mortgage multiple times?

Yes! As long as your lender allows it, you can recast multiple times, but each recast usually comes with a small fee.

### 2. Does a mortgage recast impact my credit score?

No. Unlike refinancing, a recast doesn’t require a new credit application, so it has no effect on your credit score.

### 3. Can I recast a government-backed loan like FHA or VA loans?

Most FHA, VA, and USDA loans do not allow mortgage recasting. You may need to refinance instead.

### 4. How much do lenders charge for a mortgage recast?

Fees vary by lender but typically range from $200 to $500.

### 5. Is it better to recast or make extra payments?

It depends. Recasting lowers your monthly payments, while extra payments reduce your loan term and total interest faster.

## Final Thoughts

A mortgage recast calculator is a powerful tool that helps homeowners determine how much they can save by making a lump sum payment toward their loan. If you have extra cash and want to lower your monthly payments without refinancing, a mortgage recast can be a smart financial move. However, always check with your lender to see if recasting is an option for your loan.
